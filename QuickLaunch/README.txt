*** RELEASE NOTE 20200731 ***

The lastest Eamon CS code in master branch is INCOMPATIBLE with old GAMESTATE.XML files created by previous master branch commits.  

This is due to breaking changes in the EventHeap class.

To prevent game restore issues, please finish any games you are currently playing and return all characters to the Main Hall before upgrading to the latest code.

Thank you!
