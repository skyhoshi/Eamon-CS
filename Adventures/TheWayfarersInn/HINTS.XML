                <Simple value="1. Commands may be abbreviated on the left or right side.

                <Simple value="2. Sometimes items may be in a room but won't show up until you EXAMINE them.  Pay close attention to all descriptions.  Note:  LOOK only repeats the room description and -nothing- else.  Use EXAMINE to, well, examine things.  **997" />
                <Simple value="3. Before you can manipulate items that are inside of, under or behind other items, you must REMOVE them from that item.  There is no REMOVE ALL command, but if you ATTACK a (breakable) container, all of its contents will be emptied to the **998" />
                <Simple value="4. Type SAVE and a number for a desired save position to Quick Save (save without having to verify).  Adding a description will rename that slot.  Examples:  &quot;SAVE 2&quot; or &quot;SAVE 5 Dark Room (NO GRUES)&quot;.  Also works with RESTORE.  (Type RESTORE 1, etc.)" />
                <Simple value="5. You can INVENTORY companions (normally anyone whom, when you SMILE, smiles back at you) to see what they are carrying and wearing.  You can then REQUEST those items from them.  You can also INVENTORY certain containers to get a list of contents." />
                <Simple value="6. If you GIVE food or a beverage to a friend, they will take a bite or drink and give it back to you." />
                <Simple value="7. To give money to someone, type GIVE and an amount.  For example, GIVE 1000 TO IRS AGENT would pay 1000 gold coins to the nice IRS Agent.  In most standard adventures, if you GIVE 5000 or more, a neutral monster will -usually- become your friend." />
                <Simple value="8. The POWER spell has been known to have strange and marvelous effects in many adventures.  When all else fails (or just for fun) try POWER." />

                <Simple value="2. The SETTINGS command allows you to change a variety of configuration options, which are persisted across saved games.  The settings available and their effects on gameplay can vary between adventures, so trying this command is usually helpful." />
