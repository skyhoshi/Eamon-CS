                <Simple value="3. Before you can manipulate items that are inside of, under or behind other items, you must REMOVE them from that item.  There is no REMOVE ALL command, but if you ATTACK a (breakable) container, all of its contents will be emptied to the **171" />
                <Simple value="4. Type SAVE and a number for a desired save position to Quick Save (save without having to verify).  Adding a description will rename that slot.  Examples:  &quot;SAVE 2&quot; or &quot;SAVE 5 Dark Room (NO GRUES)&quot;.  Also works with RESTORE.  (Type RESTORE 1, etc.)" />
                <Simple value="5. You can INVENTORY companions (normally anyone whom, when you SMILE, smiles back at you) to see what they are carrying and wearing.  You can then REQUEST those items from them.  You can also INVENTORY certain containers to get a list of contents." />

                <Simple value="2. The character should be an expert with HEAL and, at minimum, know SPEED.  Save the game often in case HEAL is lost due to brain overload; without this spell, the quest is likely doomed.  Be very prudent in your use of healing artifacts." />
