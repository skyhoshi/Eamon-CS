            This is the command used by the player to activate/deactivate the Trollsfire sword.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The TrollsfireCommand concrete implements this interface, which is used for dependency injection.  You will
            notice that nowhere in The Beginner's Cave is this command explicitly added to a list of available commands;
            rather, this is accomplished in <see cref="M:EamonRT.Framework.IEngine.CreateCommands"/>, which reflectively
            probes for all classes derived from <see cref="T:Eamon.Framework.Commands.ICommand"/> and adds any found.

            Gets or sets the Trollsfire property.
            </summary>
            <value>
            If Trollsfire is activated, this is one (1); else it is zero (0).
            </value>
            <remarks>
            The Trollsfire property controls whether the Trollsfire sword is alight (1) or extinguished (0).  It works in 
            conjunction with <see cref="P:TheBeginnersCave.Game.Monster.Weapon"/> and <see cref="T:TheBeginnersCave.Framework.Commands.ITrollsfireCommand"/> to fully implement
            the "Trollsfire effect".  When Trollsfire is activated the string "(alight)" is added to its StateDesc property
            and its weapon dice value is set to 10.  When deactivated, the "(alight)" string is removed and the weapon dice
            value is set to 6.  The Trollsfire property uses a complex setter to perform these actions automatically.

            Gets or sets the Weapon property.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This complex override of the Monster's Weapon property demonstrates how easy it is to produce special
            behaviors in Eamon CS with highly localized changes to default engine behavior.  In a BASIC Eamon this
            logic would be sprinkled throughout a number of commands, to check for all the scenarios where the
            Trollsfire effect might be activated/deactivated.  But realistically its all about the change in the
            Weapon property.  This handles every possible thing that could deactivate Trollsfire (also activate it
            for the pirate).  Fumbles, drops, gives, puts, takes, readies, etc.  The Weapon property works along with
            <see cref="P:TheBeginnersCave.Framework.IGameState.Trollsfire"/> and <see cref="T:TheBeginnersCave.Framework.Commands.ITrollsfireCommand"/> to
            fully implement the Trollsfire sword.
