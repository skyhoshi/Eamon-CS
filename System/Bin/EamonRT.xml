            Checks to see if the player command should be allowed to proceed.

            <param name="command">The command to check.</param>
            <remarks>
            This method takes the command identified during the parsing process and checks to see if it
            should be allowed to proceed.  The method is called immediately once the command is identified;
            the direct/indirect objects have not been parsed or resolved at this point.  You can examine 
            the command passed and take whatever actions you deem necessary, including outputting text to
            the player and/or setting the NextState command property.  If you want to abort the command
            you should set its Discarded property to true.

        <member name="M:EamonRT.Framework.IEngine.PrintMacroReplacedPagedString(System.String,System.Text.StringBuilder)">
            <summary>
            Prints the string passed in, after doing full macro replacement on it (if necessary).  If the
            string contains page separators it will be printed a page at a time.
            </summary>
            <param name="str">The string to process and print.</param>
            <param name="buf">The buffer used during string processing.</param>
            <remarks>
            Macro replacement is done using <see cref="M:Eamon.Framework.IEngine.ResolveUidMacros(System.String,System.Text.StringBuilder,System.Boolean,System.Boolean,System.Int64@)"/>.  If the
            printed string contains the page break macro <see cref="P:EamonRT.Framework.Plugin.IPluginConstants.PageSep"/> it will
            be split into pages and each page will be displayed, followed by a required user keypress.  The
            passed in buffer is used during processing and its original contents will be overwritten.  The
            passed in string will not be modified.  This method is used to print the intro story as well as
            hints, such as the author's notes.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This method works in conjunction with <see cref="M:EamonRT.Game.Commands.Command.PrintCantVerbHere"/> to disable commands
            with custom error responses in different rooms.  Note that there is also a very powerful and
            much more flexible option in <see cref="M:EamonRT.Framework.IEngine.CheckPlayerCommand(Eamon.Framework.Commands.ICommand)"/>,
            which can be used to accomplish these tasks.

            <summary>
            An implementation of the Command class that can be subclassed and overridden at the game level.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This class was introduced to allow the logic in the abstract base class Command to be overridden
            by the game designer.  This can already be done on a Command by Command basis, that is, you have to
            override each Command individually to create derived behavior.  But now you can override CommandImpl
            and every class derived from Command will inherit the modified behavior automatically.
            <para>
            Note that when subclassing and writing code in CommandImpl, you should never access its methods or
            properties directly; always access them indirectly using the Command property.  For example, use
            Command.PrintNotEnoughGold() or Command.ActorRoom, etc.  The reason for this is if a subclass of
            Command has overridden the property or method you don't want to use CommandImpl's version, you want
            that classes' override (if there is no override in the subclass, then Command will just thunk back
            over to CommandImpl's version).
